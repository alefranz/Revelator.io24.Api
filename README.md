# Revelator io24 API

This project is to be able to control a Revelator io24 interface through an API.
That way we can have plugins for Stream Deck, Touch Portal and Loupedeck... and more.

**This project is in the early stages, and a proof-of-concept only, don't expect it to be stable at this point**
