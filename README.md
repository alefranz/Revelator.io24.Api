# Revelator io24 API

This project is to be able to control a Revelator io24 interface through an API.
This way we can have plugins for Stream Deck, Touch Portal and Loupedeck... and more.

**This project is in the early stages, and a proof-of-concept only, don't expect it to be stable at this point**

## Progress
- API: A lot of bugs and early desitions, but monitoring and routing works.
- Stream Deck plugin: Routing and headphone sources, with status.
- Touch Portal plugin: not started.
- Loupedeck plugin: not started.

## How to test
- Go to [Releases](https://github.com/oddbear/Revelator.io24.Api/releases/tag/v0.0.1-pre)
- Download zip file under Assets
- Unzip
- Run `Revelator.io24.Wpf.exe`
